# drowsiness-detection-python
This project focuses on the detection of drowsiness in drivers using Python. Drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents, and this project aims to provide a solution to prevent such incidents.

The project involves using computer vision techniques to detect the driver's face and track the eye movements. The eye movements are analyzed to detect signs of drowsiness, such as prolonged eye closure or reduced blink rate.

The system generates an alert when drowsiness is detected, such as a loud sound or vibration to awaken the driver. The project also involves testing the system on a large dataset to evaluate its performance on various metrics such as sensitivity and specificity.

Overall, this project provides a useful tool for detecting drowsiness in drivers and preventing road accidents. It can be integrated into vehicles or used as a standalone device to promote safer driving practices.
